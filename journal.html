                    In my cybersecurity observations, I noticed that many passwords are easy to guess, 
                    often using common words or simple number patterns. I also observed that some users reuse 
                    the same password across multiple accounts, which increases the risk of unauthorized access.

                    Learning cybersecurity means understanding how to protect computers, networks, and data from 
                    various threats. It also involves recognizing the importance of strong passwords and safe online 
                    practices.

                    During the activity at Rivan IT Cebu, we engaged in hands-on networking practice, which allowed us to 
                    apply the concepts we previously learned in class. I observed how important proper cable management is in 
                    maintaining an organized and efficient workspace.
